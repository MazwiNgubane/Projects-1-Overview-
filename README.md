## CMPG323-Overview---30336570

OverView of of Projects of CMPG 323 which is the module that provides end-to-end and exposure to real-life industry problems to solvein the sam manner that  i will be expected to complete in industry.

##                              Business Context

NWU Tech Trends is a conceptual and fictitious new emerging consulting firm that specialises in software development with specific focus on Data Integration, GenAI (Generative Artificial Intelligence), and Automation.

##                               Business Problem


One of the biggest challenges that they currently face is being able to quantify the benefits and value being realised in the client environment. Not only are benefits somewhat subjective (especially qualitative benefits) but the measurements do not stay consistent.

## Proposed Solution Aproach

- Web API: A web API should be created which allows automations to store telemetry data linked to projects and clients.
- Web Application: A web application should be created to perform CRUD (create, read, update and delete) functionality on projects and clients stored within the system.
- Robotic Process Automation Testing: An RPA bot should be created to conduct testing which aims to ensure that the web application functions as it is intended to.
- Reporting: A report should be created to visualise the time and cost savings accumulated per project and client over time.

  ## Repositories that will be used
- CMPG 323 Overview repository

  The first repository created which is the repository that will be used for planning the whole projects using Agile(Scrum) Approach & Source control, using Kanban Project in GitHub, which is the project that provide several benefit for Agile development like giving the team members a clear overview.
  
- CMPG 323 Project 2 - 30336570

  which is the repository that will store code for CRUD RESTfull API that will connect to a 
  database storing basic telementry data.

- CMPG 323 Project 3 - 30336570

  This repository will be used to store Web App (standard) or an existing Blazor that will be 
  enhanced and improved to manage CRUD fanctionality of project and client data

- CMPG 323 Project 4 - 30336570

  
this repository will store a Testing Automation RPA UiPath project, that will test crucial part of our solotion. RPA is used to automate time-consuming and highly repetitive task.

-  CMPG 323 Project 5 - 30336570

this project will  store Power BI AI project that will be used for data Visualization and data Analysis
  
## Branching strategies to be used 

- Git Flow banching strategy will be used for project 2 and project 3, which is the branching strategy that uses two branches - main branch and develop branch that remain for the entire lifetime of he project and other short-live added branches that are created when needed to manage development process for example feature, hotflix, and release after  used they are deleted. the main two branch  amin branch contain ready code  and develop branch is used for development.

- Trunk-Based branching strategy will be used in project 4 and project 5 which is the branching strategy in which all developers make changes to main branch also called trunk, because it encourage frequent integration.

#                               Business Problem


One of the biggest challenges that they currently face is being able to quantify the benefits and value being realised in the client environment. Not only are benefits somewhat subjective (especially qualitative benefits) but the measurements do not stay consistent.

# Proposed Solution Aproach

- Web API: A web API should be created which allows automations to store telemetry data linked to projects and clients.
- Web Application: A web application should be created to perform CRUD (create, read, update and delete) functionality on projects and clients stored within the system.
- Robotic Process Automation Testing: An RPA bot should be created to conduct testing which aims to ensure that the web application functions as it is intended to.
- Reporting: A report should be created to visualise the time and cost savings accumulated per project and client over time.

  # Repositories that will be Created

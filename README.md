# CMPG323-Overview---30336570

OverView of of Projects of CMPG 323 which is the module that provides end-to-end and exposure to real-life industry problems to solvein the same manner that  i will be expected to complete in industry.


  ## Repositories that will be used
- CMPG 323 Overview repository

  The first repository created which is the repository that will be used for planning the whole projects using Agile(Scrum) Approach & Source control, using Kanban Project in GitHub, which is the project that provide several benefit for Agile development like giving the team members a clear overview.
  
- CMPG 323 Project 2 - 30336570

  which is the repository that will store code for CRUD RESTfull API that will connect to a 
  database storing basic telementry data.

- CMPG 323 Project 3 - 30336570

  This repository will be used to store Web App (standard) or an existing Blazor that will be 
  enhanced and improved to manage CRUD fanctionality of project and client data

## Branching strategies to be used 
### git flow

- Git Flow banching strategy will be used for project 2 and project 3, which is the branching strategy that uses two branches - main branch and develop branch that remain for the entire lifetime of he project and other short-live added branches that are created when needed to manage development process for example feature, hotflix, and release after  used they are deleted. the main two branch  amin branch contain ready code  and develop branch is used for development.

  
### Trunk-Base

![Trunk-base](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17c376a5-084a-403f-9c1d-3e803254be62)


- Trunk-Based branching strategy will be used in project 4 and project 5 which is the branching strategy in which all developers make changes to main branch also called trunk, because it encourage frequent integration.

  ## Gitignore file

  - gitignore file is the file that is plain text file that cotain a list of all the specified files and folders from the project that git must ingore and not track, it is used to tell git to ignore folder and file that are unnecessary to tranked in are project.

## storage of credentials and sensitive information

  storage of credentials and sensitive information in within the project is something that most be careful handled like for example we must not forget to include most of .Json file  to gitignore file simple because it  credentials and  sensitive information making it a good vulnerable.
